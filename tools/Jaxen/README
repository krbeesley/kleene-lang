Jaxen

To compile Kleene from source, you need jaxen-1.1.6-bin.tar.gz

For license information, see kleene-lang/NOTICE.

For the easy way to install this library and make it available
to Kleene, see kleene-lang/tools/README

****** the lines below are notes, not instructions

If the easy way is not possible or appropriate you will
need to download jaxen-1.1.6-bin.tar.gz from
	http://www.cafeconleche.org/jaxen/
into 	
	kleene-lang/tools/Jaxen/

jaxen-1.1.6-bin.tar.gz is "the 1.1.6 binaries in tar/gz format"

	There should be a 1.1.3, but
	dist.codehous.org/jaxen/distributions did not have the tar.gz
	file; stay with 1.1.1 for now
