JavaCC
Needed to compile the Kleene.jjt file into Kleene.jj and then
Kleene.java

You need to download the JavaCC library only if you are
compiling Kleene from scratch.

For license information, see kleene-lang/NOTICE

For the easy way to install it, see kleene-lang/tools/README

****** lines below are notes, not instructions

If the easy way is not possible or convenient, you
need to download javacc-5.0.tar.gz

from:   http://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads

to:     tools/JavaCC/

	needs javacc-5.0.tar.gz
	
2012-04-01
	Had javacc-4.2.tar.gz
	Downloaded new javacc-5.0.tar.gz
	Fixed the Makefiles
	Note that javacc...tar.gz does not reduce to a .jar library,
	rather the Makefile extracts javacc-5.0/bin/, which contains
	javacc and javah
