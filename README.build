	DON'T PANIC

You do NOT need to "build" Kleene from the source files if you are
installing a pre-compiled binary.  If a pre-compiled binary will work for
you (see README.install), all is relatively simple.  You do not need to
read this README.build file.

	Beware:

Building Kleene from source is currently a game for Experts Only.
And for now it's a game only for Linux.  (Kleene-on-Windows is
a project for the distant future.)

******************************************************************

To build Kleene from source on Linux:


1.  See README.git to clone a copy of the kleene-lang/ directory from
Github.

2a.  Once you have the downloaded the source code, there are also some
external libraries that need to be downloaded separately.  cd to the
tools/ directory

$ cd kleene-lang/tools

and read the README file carefully; follow its instructions.  The easy
way, described in detail in this README file, is to download
kleene-lang-dependencies.tar.gz from www.kleene-lang.org, unpack it, and
move the resulting kleene-lang-dependencies directory into the same
directory as the kleene-lang directory.  Then in kleene-lang/tools/
enter the command

$ make links

2b. Alternatively, you can try to grab the dependencies directly from
their sources on the internet and rebuild them from scratch:

$ cd kleene-lang/tools
$ ./download.sh

3.  To build Kleene on Linux you will need the g++ compiler.  Install it if
necessary.

4.  To build Kleene on Linux you will need JDK 1.5+ (The Java Development
Kit, which includes the javac compiler).  The environment variable $JAVA_HOME
should be properly set (so that the directory $JAVA_HOME/include/ contains
the file jni.h).

5.  Once you have downloaded the source code from Github (see step 1)
and downloaded the external libraries (see step 2), and made sure
that you have g++ and a recent JDK, then

$ cd kleene-lang/kleene/src/main/java/org/kleene-lang
$ make
$ make release

which should produce a "tarball" file named kleene-mac-W.X.Y.Z.tar.gz or
kleene-linux-W.X.Y.Z.tar.gz (with digits replacing the W, X, Y and Z,
representing the release number).  

Then see the README.install file for further information about setup.

If you succeed in compiling and running Kleene on a new platform or operating
system, please inform me at krbeesley (atsign) gmail (dot) com, and consider
contributing the "tarball" for use by others.
